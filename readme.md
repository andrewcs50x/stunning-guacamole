The objective is to shorten the number of clicks it takes to get to the **People** page of a company
from a job listing on linkedin.com

Context menu gives you a chance to open a new tab directly on the **People** page instead of
opening the main company page, waiting for it to load, then clicking on **People**.

When viewing the most popular almas mater of the employee base, it can give you an idea if
the company is legitimately operating in the same location as the home city listed on the company page.
