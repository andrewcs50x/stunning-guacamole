The objective is to shorten the number of clicks it takes to get to the **People** page of a company from a job listing on linkedin.com

Context menu (right-click) gives you a chance to open a new tab directly on the **People** page instead of opening the main company page, waiting for it to load, then clicking on **People**.

This gives the user a quick overview of the company's locations, key employees, and popular _almae matres_.

TO DO:
- [x] ~~open new tab at index + 1 instead of at the far right-hand position~~
- [ ] If invoking from a grouped tab, ensure new tab is part of the same tab group
- [ ] Extension version numbering (Chrome)
- [ ] Limit context so that the script is only enabled from a job page. It currently does not work as intended if invoked from other LI pages.
