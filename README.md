The objective is to shorten the number of clicks it takes to get to the **People** page of a company from a job listing on linkedin.com

Context menu (right-click) gives you a chance to open a new tab directly on the **People** page instead of opening the main company page, waiting for it to load, then clicking on **People**.

This gives the user a quick overview of the company's locations, key employees, and popular _almae matres_.

Upcoming improvements:
- Limiting context so that the script is only enabled from a job page. It currently does not work as intended if invoked from other LI pages.
